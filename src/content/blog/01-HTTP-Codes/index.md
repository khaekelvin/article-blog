## What are HTTP status codes?

Status codes are messages a website's server sends to the browser or system to indicate whether or not a request has been fulfilled.
Categories of status codes:

---

**• Informational responses (100 – 103):**

They are messages that alert the user to wait for a final response when the request is processing.

**• Successful responses (200 – 207):**

This category of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood, and accepted.

**• Network messages (300 – 308):**

These messages indicate that the requested content has been moved and will require further action to complete the request.

**• Client side error responses (400 – 499):**

They are messages that indicate an error caused by the clients input.

**• Server side error responses (500 – 599):**

They are messages that indicate that the server which the client is trying to access has a problem.
