## How does a webpage get to a user?

Many things happen between the time a web page is requested and the time it loads completely in your browse.

### • Client Request:

This process begins when the user enters a URL in the browser. This sends a request from the users device to the server that hosts the page that has been requested. This request is sent through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

### • Domain Name System:

For the user to efficiently communicate with the server the domain name of the user is translated into an IP address and this process is known as the DNS Resolution. The IP address is the address or location of where the webpage can be found. Once the IP address has been created, the user is able to establish a connection with the web server.

### • Server Processing:

The server receives the request and begins processing it. This processing involves making queries, running scripts or accessing resources needed to generate the requested page.

### • Server Responds:

Once the server is done processing, it returns a response to the user. It can return numerous responses such as error responses or successful responses. If the requested page does not exist anymore the server responds with a 404 error (Not found), or if the page has been moved temporarily it returns a 302 and if permanently returns a 301. If there are no errors, the server will respond successfully with a 200, which means OK and the page will be rendered.

### • Browser Renders Page:

As the browser receives the response, it begins to render the requested page. It receives the HTML file and begins rendering along the CSS and JavaScript files. These are styles and scripts used to display the webpage as intended by the website's design.

From the client request to server processing, and from DNS resolution to browser rendering, each stage plays a crucial role in delivering the web content we access every day.
